<h1>Ethernet MAC</h1>
		<p><a href="http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/lan-pages/enet.html">Ethernet</a>
 hardware addresses are 48 bits, expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits 
(0-9, plus A-F, capitalized). They might be written unhyphenated (e.g., 
123456789ABC), or with one hyphen (e.g., 123456-789ABC), but should be 
written hyphenated by octets (e.g., 12:34:56:78:9A:BC). This gives a 
theoretical 281,474,976,710,656 addresses.  This is more than 56,000 MAC
 addresses for each person on the planet! In practice, the address 
assignment policy (using flad addressing) will inevitably lead to some 
wastage - but even so, there are likely to be enougth addresses for ever
 computer, piece of networking equipment and a large numebr of 
household/office devices (heating systems, ovens, washing machines, 
fridges, drinks dispensors, security alarms, video recorders, ...) which
 could in the future be internet enabled!!!</p>
		<h3>Source Address Assignment</h3>
		<p>The 12 hex digits of source address consist of the first/left
6 digits (which should match the vendor of the Ethernet <a href="http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/lan-pages/nic.html">network
interface</a>) and the last/right 6 digits which specify the interface 
serial number for that interface controller vendor (this gives 256 cubed
 addresses - or 16.78 million separate serial numbers).</p>
		<p>The special address of all zeros (as shown below) is reserved for nodes that currently have no configured MAC address:</p>
		<p>00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
		<p>The IEEE-assigned addresses allow each vendor to assign their own 
interface serial numbers (this is a flat addressing scheme), but also 
allows protocol monitors to examine the first 3 bytes of a frame address
 to determine the manufacturere of the interface card being used.</p>
		<p>The addresses associated with interface cards are source addresses,
not multicast nor broadcast, so the second hex digit (reading
from the left) will be even, not odd. The following list identifies
some of the blocks of assigned vendor <a href="http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/lan-pages/mac.html">MAC</a>
addresses (i.e. the first 3 bytes of a MAC source address). As
an example, the Ethernet address:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>08 00 20 00 70 DF</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>corresponds to an interface manufactured by Sun Microsystems
(see below).</p>

		<p><i>Note that the first byte of the source address is always
even (since the least significant bit, or first bit on the wire
indicates that the address is a group address ).</i></p>
		<h3>Destination Address Assignment</h3>
		<p>The destination address is a valid source address, <b><i>except</i></b>
  for an address which has the lowest bit of the first byte set to '1'. 
 These addresses, including the all 1's broadcast address 
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF and the set of multicast addresses, are 
point-to-multipoint addresses and can never appear as the source address
 in an Ethernet frame.  A frame must be sent by a single source. Can you
 imagine the complications which would arise with <a href="http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/lan-pages/bridge.html">learning bridges</a> if this rule was not kept?</p>
		<h3>Internet Multicast Destination Address Assignment</h3>
		<p><img src="Ethernet%20MAC%20address%20Assignments_files/mcast-mac.gif" alt="" height="48" border="0" width="256"></p>
		<p>Multicast destination addresses also comprise an OUI and a unique 
number, but in the case of IPv4 multicast, the former part is always 
0x01005 (an OUI assigned to the IETF, shown highlighted in orange) and a
 group identifier (shown highlighted in yellow) that is derived from the
 Layer 3 multicast address. This address is mapped to the layer 2 <a href="http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/lan-pages/mac.html">destination address</a> when multicast IP addresses are sent on an Ethernet LAN.</p>
