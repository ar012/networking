1. Let's assume that the network names are 
	i. Network-1
	ii. Network-2
2. On network-1
	i. assign ip address to all the pcs [e.g. 192.168.1.0]
	ii. assign the gateway. [ the router ip address is your default gateway e.g. 192.168.1.254]
3. On router-1 [Network-1]
	i. enable
	ii. cofigure terminal
	iii. interface fastethernet 0/0 [assuming that you have connected your switch to the 0/0 port of the router]
	iv. ip address 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0
	v. no shutdown
	vi. exit
	vii. exit
	viii. copy run start
4. On network-2
	i. assign ip address to all the pcs [e.g. 200.200.200.0]
	ii. assign the gateway. [ the router ip address is your default gateway e.g. 200.200.200.254]
5. On router-2 [Network-2]
	i. enable
	ii. cofigure terminal
	iii. interface fastethernet 0/0 [assuming that you have connected your switch to the 0/0 port of the router]
	iv. ip address 200.200.200.254 255.255.255.0
	v. no shutdown
	vi. exit
	vii. exit
	viii. copy run start

6. Go to router-1 [ be sure of the fastethernet port number which is connected to the other router]
	i. configure terminal
	ii. interface fastethernet 1/0
	iii. ip address 172.16.0.1 255.255.0.0
	iv. no shutdown
	v. exit
	vi. exit
	vii. copy run start
7. Go to router-2 [ be sure of the fastethernet port number which is connected to the other router]
	i. configure terminal
	ii. interface fastethernet 1/0
	iii. ip address 172.16.0.2 255.255.0.0
	iv. no shutdown
	v. exit
	vi. exit
	vii. copy run start
